# Introduction to Python

## The Python Interface

In the Python script on the right, you can type Python code to solve the exercises. If you hit Submit Answer, your python script (script.py) is executed and the output is shown in the IPython Shell. DataCamp checks whether your submission is correct and gives you feedback.
You can hit Submit Answer as often as you want. If you're stuck, you can click Get Hint, and ultimately Get Solution.
You can also use the IPython Shell interactively by simply typing commands and hitting Enter. When you work in the shell directly, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment.


- [x] Experiment in the IPython Shell; type 5 / 8, for example.
- [x] Add another line of code to the Python script: print(7 + 10).
- [x] Hit Submit Answer to execute the Python script and receive feedback.

```python
# Example, do not modify!
print(5 / 8)

# Put code below here
print(7 + 10)
```
